# Web Project API Full

This repository contains a complete web application project with both backend and frontend. It was developed to offer a well-structured and modern architecture using current technologies.

---

## üìñ Overview

The project is divided into two main directories:

- **Backend**: Manages server logic, authentication, RESTful API, and database integration.
- **Frontend**: User interface built with React, interacting with the API provided by the backend.

---

## ‚ú® Technologies Used

### Backend

- **Node.js**: Platform for running JavaScript on the server.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for data storage.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: Authentication and authorization.
- **Mongoose**: ODM for modeling data in MongoDB.

### Frontend

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: Fast build tool for React development.
- **CSS**: For interface styling.
- **ESLint**: Configuration to ensure code quality.
